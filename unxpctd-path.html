								<!--Paragraph 1-->
								<p align="justify">Since I was young, I have developed a curiosity and high enthusiasm for things that are new and unknown to me. 
									Perhaps it's a common thing for young children who are 
									just starting to explore the small world full of expressions and mysteries trying to be revealed in various ways, 
									because everyone has their own opinions and ideas depending on their perspective in observing and concluding something.</p>
								<!--Paragraph 1 End-->

								<!--Paragraph 2-->
								<p align="justify">But even though I have a high level of curiosity, sometimes I just keep those questions in my head and only 
									contemplate while seeing how I can find answers from my own observations, although I could ask and listen and conclude something 
									just from someone else's explanation. And sometimes, if you could say, I do more things like talking to myself, spending time with my own thoughts, 
									and imagining various things that could help me overcome my boredom.</p>
								<!--Paragraph 2 End-->

								<!--Paragraph 3-->
								<p align="justify">Because when I was young, I rarely went out of the house unless there were family events or if friends 
									invited me out to play or even to play together at my house. Sometimes, it seemed like I had no interest in leaving the house 
									and only spent time with my own thoughts and imagining various things that could help me overcome my boredom. Maybe I didn't realize 
									it when I was young, but by doing that, I also closed the possibility of seeing the outside world and understanding various other things that 
									could help me in the future, and unconsciously made me lacking in knowledge in adapting to the outside environment.</p>
								<!--Paragrap 3 End-->

								<!--Paragraph 4-->
								<p align="justify">As time went by, I continued to grow and see various things. I have to keep moving forward and see how myself and even things
									 around me continue and evolve. Seeing new things and walking with them certainly isn't as easy as one might think. It's not just about seeing 
									 things from various perspectives and following the flow, but also trying to understand which path to take and even adapting and eventually growing 
									 with it. Maybe if you just think about it, it could be easy and assume that everything can be passed with mere "guesses" and "assumptions" if we want 
									 to and are less serious in "dealing with it."</p>
								<!--Paragraph 5-->

								<!--Pargraph 6-->
								<p align="justify">But the reality is not as easy as that, because everything has its obstacles and processes. Maybe that's something to think 
									about when I'm older, and the reality is indeed like that. When I was young, I was only "trying to find out" and lacked or even didn't try to 
									"understand it" because it was just about thinking about it and not trying to see the process because of a lack of enthusiasm in trying to understand in 
									order to do the best possible way to try to deal with it patiently and see how the process goes.</p>
								<!--Paragraph 6 End-->

								<!--Paragraph 7-->
								<p align="justify">Sometimes in a position, I'm afraid to see and end up not knowing what to do. It may seem easy to just think about it, but 
									sometimes when you arrive at a position where you have to involve both thoughts and feelings at the same time, that's what causes the delay in decision-making 
									and taking action in facing something we're dealing with. Because being powerless and unable to do anything always remains one of my biggest fears. 
									"But if we don't try to deal with it, we will never know."</p>
								<!--Paragrapgh 7 End-->

								<!--Pargraph 8-->
								<p align="justify">That's why it's necessary not just to think about it and try to deal with it and see how the process goes later because from there we will determine 
									"how the next path will go." Sometimes I look back at what happened in the past and try to think that not everything we think about and want will all go as we concluded 
									because everything already has its own path and directs us to the next path we will take, but just seeing and observing won't be enough because we should also determine and 
									make decisions on how the next path will go and accept it as it is even if it's not what we expected because it might be the best path for us to take.</p>
								<!--Paragraph 08 End-->

								<!--Pargraph 9-->
								<p align="justify">As time passed, I graduated from elementary school, middle school, vocational school, many changes had occurred around me and for myself. I've Experienced
									a lot to reach to this point, witnessing how complex our life paths can be, full of joys and sorrows.</p>
								<!--Paragraph 09 End-->

								<!--Pargraph 10-->
								<p align="justify">"I feel there's no need to further narrate my story and path, because everyone has their own story and journey with various twists and turns and life processes. 
									But the essence of what I want to convey is that everyone has their own unique and diverse life journey with their own ways, with both predictable and unpredictable processes.
									Just wrote your line story, live the process by bearing it and keep moving forward."</p>
								<!--Paragraph 10 End-->
